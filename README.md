# Stardle

Stardle is a daily Astronomy word guessing game powered by code from the original [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ and Canuckle).

## How to Play

Guess the STARDLE in 6 tries.
Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the colour of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

- AstroBlue: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Grey: The letter is incorrect.

The answer will be a word related to Astronomy in some way, and a fun fact may be displayed after you play!

A new STARDLE will be available each day!
